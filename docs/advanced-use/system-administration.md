## Web Hooks

You can use the Web Hooks to send events from Flagsmith into your own infrastructure. Web Hooks are managed at an
Environment level, and can be configured in the Environment settings page.

Currently the following events will generate a Web Hook action:

- Creating Features (Sent as event_type `FLAG_UPDATED`)
- Updating Feature value / state in an Environment (Sent as event_type `FLAG_UPDATED`)
- Overriding a Feature for an Identity (Sent as event_type `FLAG_UPDATED`)
- Overriding a Feature for a Segment (Sent as event_type `FLAG_UPDATED`)

You can define any number of Web Hook endpoints per Environment. Web Hooks can be managed from the Environment settings
page.

A typical use case for Web Hooks is if you want to cache flag state locally within your server environment.

Each event generates an HTTP POST with the following body payload to each of the Web Hooks defined within that
Environment:

```json
{
 "data": {
  "changed_by": "Some User",
  "new_state": {
   "enabled": true,
   "environment": 23,
   "feature": {
    "created_date": "2020-02-25T22:11:16.355547Z",
    "default_enabled": false,
    "description": null,
    "id": 2411,
    "initial_value": "blue",
    "name": "feature_name",
    "project": 12,
    "type": "FLAG|CONFIG"
   },
   "feature_segment": null,
   "feature_state_value": null,
   "id": 10430,
   "identity": null,
   "identity_identifier": null
  },
  "previous_state": {
   "enabled": false,
   "environment": 23,
   "feature": {
    "created_date": "2020-02-25T22:11:16.355547Z",
    "default_enabled": false,
    "description": null,
    "id": 2411,
    "initial_value": "red",
    "name": "feature_name",
    "project": 12,
    "type": "FLAG|CONFIG"
   },
   "feature_segment": null,
   "feature_state_value": null,
   "id": 10430,
   "identity": null,
   "identity_identifier": null
  },
  "timestamp": "2020-03-07T13:59:07.040Z"
 },
 "event_type": "FLAG_UPDATED"
}
```

## Audit Log Webhooks

You can use Audit Log Webhooks to stream your Organisation's Audit Log into your own infrastructure. This can be useful
for compliance or to reference against local CI/CD infrastructure.

```json
{
 "created_date": "2020-02-23T17:30:57.006318Z",
 "log": "New Flag / Remote Config created: my_feature",
 "author": {
  "id": 3,
  "email": "user@domain.com",
  "first_name": "Kyle",
  "last_name": "Johnson"
 },
 "environment": null,
 "project": {
  "id": 6,
  "name": "Project name",
  "organisation": 1
 },
 "related_object_id": 6,
 "related_object_type": "FEATURE"
}
```
