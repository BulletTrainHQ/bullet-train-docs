title: The Flagsmith REST API
sidebar_label: REST API
---

Flagsmith is built around a client/server architecture. The REST API server is accessible from SDK clients as well as
the administration front end. This decoupling means that you can programmatically access the entire API if you wish.

You can view the current REST API via Swagger at
[https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/docs/](https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/docs/).

## Authentication

There are two main types of API access:

1. Publicly accessible endpoints (such as those consumed by the client SDKs). These simply require an environment key in
   the HTTP header.
2. Private endpoints that require a secure token to access.

## Public Endpoints

Every time you create a new Project Environment, an environment API key is automatically generated for you. This is all
you need to pass in to get access to Flags etc.

```bash
curl 'https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/flags/' -H 'x-environment-key: <ENVIRONMENT KEY>'
```

## Private Endpoints

You can also do things like create new flags, environments, toggle flags or indeed anything that is possible from the
administrative front end via the API.

To authenticate, get a token by logging in with an account credentials:

```bash
curl 'https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/auth/login/' \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data-binary '{"email":"<ACCOUNT EMAIL ADDRESS>","password":"<ACCOUNT PASSWORD>"}'

{"key":"<KEY HASH>"}
```

Then use this token for subsequent requests. For example, to create a new environment:

```bash
curl 'https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/environments/' \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -H 'authorization: Token <TOKEN FROM PREVIOUS STEP>' \
    --data-binary '{"name":"New Environment","project":"<Project ID>"}'
```
