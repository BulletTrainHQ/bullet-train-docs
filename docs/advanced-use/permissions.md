description: Team member and group permissions.

Flagsmith provides fine-grained permissions to help larger teams manage access and roles across projects and
environments.

Permissions are assigned to individual team members or to groups.

## Groups

Groups are a convenient way to manage permissions for multiple team members. Groups can contain any number of team
members. You can create groups with the Organisation Settings page.

## Organisations

Team members can be defined as Organisation Administrators. This is effectively a super-user role, and gives full
read/write access to every Project, Environment, Flag, Remote Config and Segment within that organisation.

## Projects

Team Members and Groups can be given individual roles at a Project level.

| **Role**           | **Ability**                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Administrator      | Full Read/Write over all Environments, Feature Flag, Remote Config and Segment values |
| View Project       | Can view the Project within their account                                             |
| Create Environment | Can create new Environments within the Project                                        |
| Create Feature     | Can create a new Feature / Remote Config                                              |
| Delete Feature     | Can remove an existing Feature / Remote Config entirely from the Project              |
