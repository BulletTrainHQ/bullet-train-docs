description: Every action taken within the Flagsmith administration application is tracked and logged.

Every action taken within the Flagsmith administration application is tracked and logged. This allows you to easily
retrace the events and values that flags, identities and segments have taken over time.

You can view the Audit Log within the Flagsmith application, and filter it in order to find the information you are
after.

You can also stream your Audit Logs into your own infrastructure using
[Audit Log Webhooks](/advanced-use/system-administration.md#audit-log-webhooks).
