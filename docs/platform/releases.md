new features and bug fixes since our last release:

- If your api is using influx, we now show usage data in a graph format

- Sensible page size for the users page
- Improved E2E stability
- Integration page, this page is almost fully managed by remote config. It will allow users t enhance Flagsmith with
  your favourite tools. We currently support data dog and will shortly support amplitude.

The remote config to use this is as follows:

```json
integrations:

["data_dog"]
```

```json
integration_data
{
    "perEnvironment": false,
    "image": "https://xyz",
    "fields": [
      {
        "key": "base_url",
        "label": "Base URL"
      },
      {
        "key": "api_key",
        "label": "API Key"
      }
    ],
    "tags": [
      "logging"
    ],
    "title": "Data dog",
    "description": "Sends events to Data dog for when flags are created, updated and removed. Logs are tagged with the environment they came from e.g. production."
}
```
